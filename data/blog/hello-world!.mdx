I’m Fady, a creative, multi-passionate engineer. I’m starting a blog, highly inspired by several cool people I’ve come across fairly recently. 😎

Firstly, this blog will be personal, a little corner of the internet that I can add to and grow up with.

Secondly, it will be a place to ‘share my work’. I first came across the book ‘[Share Your Work](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18290401-show-your-work)‘ by Austin Kleon, It’s a short, insightful read on the benefits of learning in public and, well, sharing your work! A brilliant example of this is [Scott Hanselman’s blog](https://www.hanselman.com/) where he has been sharing his notes online for nearly 20 years! I discovered him through a retweet of [one of his talks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HE5LJwAv1k).

> _“One little blog post is nothing on its own, but publish a thousand blog posts over a decade, and it turns into your life’s work.” - Austin Kleon_

I’m super excited to have a space to share my thoughts, notes, current and future learning. In the words of Austin Kleon, “__become a documentarian of what you do__“.
