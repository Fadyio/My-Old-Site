### About me

Iâ€™m a software developer. and I have bachelor degree in information technology. I have one main opinion about programming and computer science, which is that deeply understanding the underlying systems you use is essential if you want to be able to solve hard problems.
i am also curious about lots of things, My tech journey started off in the days of Windows 98 when I was eleven years old. I loved playing around with programs like MS Paint, Publisher, Word Art, Throughout school and college my interest in digital work grew, I've loved continuous learning, and developed a huge interest in _computer science_ and coding.
