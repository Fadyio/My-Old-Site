**Information for people wishing to use this code**

**Don't. This code is not made for you to use without extensive modification.The source for this site was not created to be a template or theme, but for my own use. Feel free to take whatever inspiration from it that you want, but this code was not written with the intention of being cloned and deployed. As such, I do not provide support or guidance for doing that. I recommend using the [fernfolio template](https://github.com/TylerMRoderick/fernfolio-11ty-template)to set up a blog or an existing theme created for that purpose.**

If you are still adamant about using this backend, please keep several things in
mind:

1. All blog content is all rights reserved. I aggressively pursue and report
   content theft.
2. You are on your own. I will not help you.
3. Upon security issues being found and remediated, you will not be notified
   about issues or remediation instructions.
