Remove comments (except conditional comments).

When configured with `force: true` (default: `false`), conditional comments
are also removed.

The default export is `rehypeRemoveComments`

   .use(rehypeParse)
+  .use(rehypeRemoveComments)

   .process('<span>some html</span>', function (err, file) {
     console.error(report(err || file))
     console.log(String(file))
   })
```
